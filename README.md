# StalkingCryptoBot

## Solana Transaction Tracker and Token Trading Bot
- This project is a Node.js application that tracks transactions at a specific location in the Solana wallet and simulates token trading on Binance as a change in the wallet. The application uses the Solana Web3.js library to connect to the Solana blockchain and track transactions. When a transaction is detected, the app checks the balance of the wallet and makes a simulated purchase or sale of the token. Balance before and after transactions
- In that simulated environment the price of the specifed token will increase by specific persent, whenever someone buys the token and decrease if someone sells the same token
